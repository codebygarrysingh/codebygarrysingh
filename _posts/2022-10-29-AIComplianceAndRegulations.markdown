  <p>
	AI is evolving at a rapid pace and concerns about the fair and ethical use of technology and data are deepening. To address these concerns, many countries and regions are actively working on developing guidelines and regulations. The EU has introduced the AI Act in 2021 to regulate AI systems' safety and ethics. Many leading nations have adopted similar approaches.

Various tools and initiatives are in progress to address ethical, compliance, and quality aspects of AI/ML applications. These tools and initiatives aim to mitigate risks associated with AI deployment, such as risks to privacy, human dignity, fundamental liberties, and democracy.

As we progress towards growing <a href="https://dataconomy.com/2023/03/09/what-is-autonomous-artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank">autonomy</a> and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/adaptive-ai" target="_blank">adaptivity</a> of Machine Learning systems, the concerns related to fair and ethical use of technology and data are deepening. While the world grappeled with the unprecidented spread of Covid-19 and had to brace for the impact from one of a kind epidemic, there was another remarkable development taking its majestic steps towards maturity. We saw a rise in popularity of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence" target="_blank">Generalized AI</a> models more than ever before with more advanced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence" target="_blank">Generative AI</a> models, Computer vision & speech models and their applications take over the market. There is a saying that goes around in Silicon Valley that goes "Keep innovating and laws/regulations will eventually catch up". 

This wave of unforseen takeover of AI/ML models, left Government's around the work scrounging for experienced scientists, professors, veterans of the industry and lawmakers to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/spring-budget-2023/spring-budget-2023-html" target="_blank">assemble active task forces</a>. The task forces had a collective goal to put their heads together towards a comprehensive compliance, regulatory, and quality assurance frameworks as principal guidelines for innovations in AI and ML. 

The EU became pioneers by introducing first of its kind <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A52021PC0206" target="_blank">AI Act in 2021</a> to regulate AI systems' safety and ethics. Many leading nations adopted similar approach towards a holistic and collaborative approach to development of consolidated set of practices. Many countries and regions are still actively working on developing guidelines and regulations to address the ethical and compliance challenges posed by AI and machine learning technologies. While most of the proposed acts are currently being assessed as mere best practices and are using <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-regulation-a-pro-innovation-approach" target="_blank">Pro-innovation approach</a> to enable rather than stifling responsible innovation.

**AI Regulation and Compliance Frameworks**

This table provides an overview of various AI regulation and compliance classifications along with brief summaries of each category's key concerns and considerations. The table helps in understanding the diverse aspects of AI governance and compliance, emphasizing the importance of addressing issues such as bias, fairness, transparency, privacy, security, and more in the development and deployment of artificial intelligence technologies.
