With the continuous advancement of AI and ML technologies, there's a growing concern about the responsible and compliant use of technology and its impact on the safe handling of user data and the privacy of individuals. Users of technology have willingly embraced the convenience and benefits of technology applications, services, and products in exchange for their personal information, private data, and predictive data linked to their behavior, usage patterns, and conversations. However, the misuse and commoditization of user data, its exchange with third parties, and its analysis for behavioral insights and targeted advertisements are putting individuals' privacy at risk.

As the number of applications, services, and devices continues to grow, the volume of data associated with users is expanding exponentially. This data is distributed across multiple platforms and has become a valuable asset for corporations. However, it is also a growing concern for individuals who have unwittingly surrendered control over their personal information and intellectual property.

The proposal is to establish a centralized, distributed, and privatized solution that empowers users to regain control over their data, similar to how they hold the keys to their homes. In the past, service personnel would knock on your door, and you had the authority to decide whether to welcome them in, ask them to leave, or interact with them. You retained ownership and central control over your property. However, the modern digital landscape has evolved in a way that has allowed various "service personnel" to enter our digital lives and take control, often without our full awareness. These entities offer us convenience, entertainment, comfort, and more, but they also collect, exchange, and profit from our data. This loss of control puts our personal information and independence at risk.

The core concept is to create a centralized blockchain system that functions as the digital "key" to our personal data, including personally identifiable information, behavioral patterns, and analysis. Access to this central system would require the user's explicit permission, ensuring that individuals, not corporations, have control over their data. Time is of the essence, as we are on the cusp of an era where superintelligent systems may further erode our privacy and independence.

In a world where voice, face, thumbprints, and personal information are increasingly integral to any interaction with internet-connected applications, services, or devices, it's crucial to provide users with the option to keep their data private and secure. This solution would also include a failsafe mechanism to allow users to erase their data or download it in the event of a data breach or epidemic.

Furthermore, the proposal aims to enforce standards and promote the exchange of data by users through this central blockchain system. Companies seeking access to user data for their platforms' functionality would have to request permission, and any non-identifiable data about a user could be stored in models maintained by the company. Users would have the option to monetize any additional data related to their behaviors, provided it has a clear and transparent usage trail.

In conclusion, democratizing data through a centralized blockchain system empowers users to take control of their digital lives and ensures that the war for global digital independence is one that individuals can win. It's a crucial step towards protecting user privacy, maintaining data ownership, and enabling data exchange on fair terms.
