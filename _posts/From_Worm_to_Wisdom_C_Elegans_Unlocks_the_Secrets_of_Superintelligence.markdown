I just finished reading Nick Bostrom’s groundbreaking book, “Superintelligence,” where he explores the concept of superintelligent entities and the potential implications of their existence. While much of the book delves into hypothetical scenarios involving advanced AI, there are several fascinating and tangible examples that Bostrom discusses. One such example that has been gaining momentum in the realm of superintelligent AI as we approach technological singularity is the humble nematode worm, Caenorhabditis elegans, or C. elegans (pictured below). This unassuming organism, with its 302 neurons, holds remarkable relevance in our quest to understand the foundations of intelligence. C. elegans is one of the simplest microorganisms, with the lowest number of neurons, yet it possesses a well-characterized nervous system and genetic tractability. It offers valuable insights that resonate with today’s scientific and technological landscape.

C. Elegans are mere a millimeter in length and may appear insignificant to a naked eye, or for that fact someone looking at it under a microscope. The significance is realized when you put on your science hat and you find a well-characterized nervous system with exactly 302 neurons and 7,000 synapses, researchers have painstakingly mapped its neural circuitry. The compactness of its nervous system makes it an ideal subject for investigating the fundamental principles underlying neurobiology and behavior.

Leading research projects in prestigious, well-funded research facilities and laboratories are currently directed towards the comprehensive mapping of neural machine learning (ML) models, inspired by the neural wiring of C. elegans. This ambitious endeavor seeks to unravel the intricate interactions of synapses and behaviors exhibited by these models when exposed to a diverse range of external factors and characteristics.

One particularly intriguing example, stemming from my own personal experience, revolves around my involvement in a collaborative research effort with NASA, initiated by fellow researchers at the University of Oxford. This project had a compelling objective: to explore the effects of prolonged exposure to non-gravitational conditions and the unique atmosphere of the International Space Station on the physical and psychological well-being of astronauts.

In this context, the neural wiring of C. elegans serves as a valuable blueprint for constructing ML models capable of adapting to dynamic and unfamiliar conditions. By studying these models in the extreme environment of space, we aim to gain insights into how neural circuits and behavior respond to the challenges of living beyond Earth’s gravity. This research not only expands our understanding of neurobiology but also has important implications for ensuring the safety and well-being of astronauts as they embark on extended missions in space.

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
